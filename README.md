## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Preprocessor, SCSS
- JavaScript
- DOM

### What I learned

- I tested my CSS skills, using grid box model, media queries, flexbox and DOM.

### Continued development

This project tested my skills but I'm looking forward to more projects to build in the future.

### Useful resources
